Any collected info on codes in the school

I used a flipper zero during these years and will update if i get anything else. Currently no other can do the stuff i do in school. This is for future students.

RFID folder contains any collected RFID tags for school lockers each with the responding EM4100 Data

Sub-ghz folder contains the codes collected on the doors able to be open with a transmitter.

Infrared contains the codes for projectors of classes and auditoriums.
